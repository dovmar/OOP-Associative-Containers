Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program to 
accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such
as: analysis, generating algorithms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm , profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms
in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one 
or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.
